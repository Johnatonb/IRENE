dataset_grooves
    images
        train : dataset of fixed width artificial grooves used for training (prototype 1)
        test : dataset of fixed width artificial grooves used for testing (prototype 1)
        noisy_train : same dataset as train folder, but noised artificially with random thin black rectangles and gaussian noise (prototype 2)
        noisy_test : same dataset as test folder, but noised artificially with random thin black rectangles and gaussian noise (prototype 2)
        noisier_train : same dataset as noisy_train, with thick black rectangles added randomly (prototype 2)
        noisier_test : same dataset as noisy_test, with thick black rectangles added randomly (prototype 2)
    sounds : sound waves generated by Weaver for each groove in the images folder. Each contains the image filename. (prototype 1)
    random_grooves
        train : dataset of random width artificial grooves used for training (prototype 2)
        test : dataset of random width artificial grooves
        noisy_test : same dataset as test folder, but randomly noised with thin or thick black rectangles and gaussian noise. Used for testing. (prototype 2)
models
    model0...9999 : model parameters, architecture, summary and trained weights
results
    model0...9999 : list of results for each partial training (JSON), audio predictions
disc_data : disc image, corresponding track, corresponding audio
disc_sim_data
    train : dataset of random width artificial grooves used for training (prototype 4)
    test : dataset of random width artificial grooves
